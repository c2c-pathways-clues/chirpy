## The C2C Pathways

**BEST BUY TEEN TECH CENTERS IN 21 U.S. COMMUNITIES** have been selected to create C2C Pathways programming at their sites in 2020-21. Building on lessons learned from prior years, C2C Pathways to Success programs will provide selected youth with the opportunity to focus on a specific area of technology (e.g., web development, tech support, graphic design), develop their workforce readiness skills, and gain real-world work experience through an internship placement. Staff will follow up regularly with C2C Pathways to Success participants to provide career guidance and advice during the internship and beyond.
